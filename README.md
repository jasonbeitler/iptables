# iptables

This is just a basic iptables lockdown. Not much more to say. 

* Note some changes need to be made to Time and DNS. You will need to adjust to fit your needs. Pay close attention to DNS and if you are using a Corporate VPN you will need to add those DNS servers or it will not work.

Other than that, read the comments and you will be fine.

Tested on
* Debian 
* Ubuntu
* CentOS
* RHEL

Should work on any Linux distro that uses iptables.
